*** Structure
45-60 min

5 min warmup
5 min at the end to ask questions
35-50 min of situational, behavioral and tech questions

figure out which bucket it's comin from

tech questions will be on whiteboard, paper or IDE
junior dev interviews at Amazon consist of at least 4 of those interviews

situational, behavioral, and technical questions

situational:
what WOULD you do

behavioral:
what DID you do

traits thay are valued at amazon:

1. dealing with ambiguity
2. bias for action
  a. You saw something that needed to be done and you did it.
3. delivery
4. ownership
  a. Caring about the product

take soft questions and turn them into examples of how i kicked butt.

tech questions come in three flavors:

1. Depth of knowledge on items on your resume/stack
2. Brain teasers
3. Problem solving questions that will require code or a design exercise

BUCKETS of problem-solving questions:

1. Data structures
2. Algorithms
3. Abstract Analysis


problem solving questions are not about the answer  
  -the best way to prepare is to understand the types and patterns of the questions and answers


Data structures:

- primitive types
- arrays/strings
- lists/stacks/queues
- binary trees/heaps/hash tables/graph

thinking out loud unlocks potential hints

don't write code until you know what you're going to write

an abstract data type

  - An abstract data type is a contract for data and operations

List, for example:

Add(value)
Get(index)
Delete(index)
Find(value)

Data structures are implentations of those interfaces

Array Lists are good if you have a static amount of information and are constantly getting from an index

Linked List if you're constantly adding/subtracting

Detecting a cycle in a linked-list
LEARN HOW TO DO THIS.
